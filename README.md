### 1. Binary-Search-Tree Implementation
The problem is decompposed intothe following set of functions:-

* **addElem**: add an object to binary search tree based on its magnitude
* **isThere**: searches for a particular object in ordered tree
* **numElems**: counts the number of objects in the binary search tree excluding the empty
nodes using concept of scala recursion
* **maxDepth**: finds the height of the tree/depth of the tree recursively
* **Inorder**: traverse the tree in left, root and right fashion and display the result using a list

### 2. Secant Method Implementation

Secant method is a recursive method for finding the root for the polynomials by successive approximations.
